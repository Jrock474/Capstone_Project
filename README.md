# Capstone_Project
   'KANRI-MONO'

# Inspiration for Project
Idea by Anthony Badilla
'Tomagatchi' inspired video game

# Technologies Used
React, Vite, CSS, Javascript, HTML, Sequelize, Node.js, Nodemailer, Express, Postgres, Bcrypt, React-Router-DOM, Bootstrap

# Explanations for Tech Used
React is the framework handling everything
CSS to style the pages
Javascript for the logic
HTML for inputs and other tags
Sequelize to handle the database
Node.js to handle dependencies
Nodemailer to email the user upon registration
Express for the server functionality
Postgres to communicate with the backend
Bcrypt to encrypt passwords in database
React-Router-DOM to re-route user to different pages
Bootstrap for the Nav Bar

# Home Page
The home page allows you to sign up or login. UseNavigate (a hook from react-router-dom) allows clicking the img that says 'Login' or 'SignUp' to take you to the appropriate page without any reloading. This allows for quicker load times and easy access to other pages.

# Login Page
The login page lets the user input their username and password created on the registration page. If the wrong password is entered, an appropriate error message shows up.

# Registration Page
The registration or sign up page lets the user input a username, password, security question, security answer and email. If there are any error (ie. passwords do not match or email is already in use) the appropriate error message is shown.

# Delete Account
The delete account page lets the user delete his or her account associated with their email and security answer. This removes the data from the Postgres table as well.

# Weather Page
The weather page allows the user to input their city and have the game show a window with that city's weather in real time. The data is fetched using a real-time weather api for the best accuracy possible.
